Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - NYC Real Estate App
===========================================================

What did I learn in this project?
---------------------------------

In this project I learned how to use the Google Maps API to create a map of NYC with a number of additional interactive features. Several libraries within the Google Maps API were used such as Places, Geometry, Drawing, and Autocomplete. I learned how to implement new markers on the map based on user input and to display place details or other useful information when a user clicks on a marker. I learned how to experiment with custom styling of the map such as how roads, water, text and other elements of the map are styled. This project taught me a ton about the extensive amount of data and features contained in the Google Maps API libraries and ideas of how to implement the API for interesting potential uses in future projects.
