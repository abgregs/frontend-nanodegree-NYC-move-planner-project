Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - NYC Move Planner App
===========================================================

What Is It?
---------------------------------
This was a learning project built around the idea of making an app for planning a move to NYC. The lessons explored ways of using the Google Maps API to introduce new features to the app, such as a search feature using autocomplete to find areas of interest and a listings filter to show apartments based on the commute to your office or other nearby locations.


What Did I Learn?
---------------------------------

In this project I learned how to use the Google Maps API to create a map of NYC with a number of additional interactive features. Several libraries within the Google Maps API were used such as Places, Geometry, and Drawing. I learned how to implement new markers on the map based on user input and to display place details or other useful information when a user clicks on a marker. I learned how to experiment with custom styling of the map such as how roads, water, text and other elements of the map are styled. This project taught me about the extensive documentation and features of the Google Maps API libraries and ideas for interesting potential uses in future projects.
